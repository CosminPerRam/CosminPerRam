# Cosmin-Lucian Pătrînjan (CosminPerRam)

Always looking forward to create something new.

I enjoy a lot working on FOSS (or personal) projects, `rust` is currently my favorite language.

*How did I got here?* I just put a lot of hours into it, and one day I woke up realising I've made something noticeable.
